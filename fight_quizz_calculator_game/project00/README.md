 # ASCII Little Adventures
    ####s Decription: Well, i'll try to describe my project part for part, firts let's talk about what do we have in there. There are two main menus, first one is language menu, where you pick
    from only two options sadly, english and spanish. Second one it's the "game menu", where you can choose to jump right into the games, read the intructions or go back to pick another language.
    Let's say that you picked to jump righ into the games, you'll have to pick from four different options, PATH A,B,C,D. Path A is a text based game where you need to save your life choosing your
    word carefully, PATH B is a fighting game where you have to defeat different bosses, PATH C consists of two "mini-games" first one it's much more like path a but more of a trivia you could say
    and the second one it's just a "dice game" where you need to score higher than your opponent, it's two player based.

    The instructions panel it's really important to check so you don't just jump in into the games with out knowing what are you doing. So let's talk a little about the code and my tought process while
    making it.
    I really enjoyed making it by the way, the easier way for me to do it was to "abuse" from try and except in a while loop, user input it's really important so in this loops y always tried to minimize
    complexity by just answering with numbers from one to four for example, apart from that, every time i was creating a new stage in the game or something like that i would create a new function (if the
    ones that were already created didn't work for that particulr thing) wich made things much more clear for me while writing the code.

    In terms of difficulty, i know it's pretty simple but either way im happy with the results, it took me a lot of time and there was some things that needed more time than anothers but in the end it felt
    pretty good. Speaking of wich, it really help me getting a better mindset for future projects, i feel like i was kind of excited on making my first project so i went in and make things harder for no reason,
    what i mean by that is that now i have a better idea of planningn ahead before jumping into the pool.

    I guess i need to speak more about my code, but i said is pretty straight foward and doesn't complicate in any way, what im not proud of is that i feel like there is a lot of repetition that i could't avoid,
    one thing i knew before starting to code and it was DO NOT repeat code, but there where cases where i just could't figure it out so repeating it was the last resource.

    Talking about code again, for expample the first text based adventure game, you end up in hell and have a conversation with a demon, about life, humans and thing like that, you either choose right or die,
    simple as that. The way i decided to make  was, stick to conditionals and loops with try and except for getting the right input. Every time a new stage appears it's probably a new function (like a change in
    the current place of the game). For most text adventures in the different games of the project the structure was the same, but some of them ended up way more entertaining than the others, fighting game was
    more challenging to write for obvious reasons but at the same time, more enjoyable.

    Those moments where you are stuck, don't have any idea what is happening and you end up solving the issue is one thing that CS50 teaches you and im so gratefull for that, im not saying that now i can solve
    most of my coding problems just like that, but the idea of been able to do it, because you have done it before it's amaizing. My sincerely thanks for everything in this course, a lot of times i was frustrated,
    lost or confused but in the end it was all worth it.
